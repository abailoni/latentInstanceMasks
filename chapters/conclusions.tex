\section{Conclusions}
We have presented a new proposal-free method predicting encoded \maskname masks in a sliding window style, one for each pixel of the input image, and introduced a parameter-free approach to aggregate predictions from overlapping masks and obtain all instances concurrently.
When applied to large volumetric biological images, the resulting method proved to be strongly robust to noise and compared favorably to competitor methods based on super-pixels.
The proposed method also makes predictions with associated uncertainty, depending on the consensus of the overlapping \maskname masks. In future work, we plan to use these predictions to predict uncertainty on the final instances, which could largely improve the subsequent proof-reading step still needed in neuron segmentation.
