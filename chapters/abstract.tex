\begin{abstract}
This work introduces a new proposal-free instance segmentation method, which predicts single-instance segmentation masks across the entire image in a sliding window style.
Compared to related approaches, our method concurrently predicts all masks, one for each pixel, in a low dimensional latent representation, which results in great memory savings strictly required for applications to large volumetric images. 
Predictions from overlapping masks are then combined into edge weights of a graph that is subsequently partitioned to obtain all final instances concurrently.
The result is a parameter-free method that is strongly robust to noise and prioritizes predictions with the highest consensus across overlapping masks. 
We test our method on the challenging CREMI 2016 neuron segmentation benchmark where it achieves competitive scores. In our extensive set of comparison experiments, we show how predicting encoded masks performs favorably compared to other competitive proposal-free methods predicting pixel-pair affinities.
